Instructions for compiling the RDS RTSP library on Linux.

1. Obtain the RTSP library source code from SVN.

If you are reading this file, chances are you have already done this and
you can skip this step.

    svn co https://subversion.jf.intel.com/mg/mpg/mpci/Wireless_Display/Sources/WiDi/rtsp

2. Obtain the global Include files for WiDi.

    cd rtsp
    svn co https://subversion.jf.intel.com/mg/mpg/mpci/Wireless_Display/Sources/WiDi/Include

3. Build the library.

    (Install scons if necessary: sudo apt-get install scons)

    cd rtsp
    scons

4. Build the sample sink application.

    cd snkapp_linux
    scons

5. Launch the sample application.

    ./sinkapp

6. In a separate window, launch the source tester.

    python test_source_transmitter.py

7. The source tester will output the results of the test.

<p>TGV is a successful product throughout the value chain of delivery. </p>
<p>TGV delivers value to consumers in a form convenient to both business and technical customers.</p>
<p>Benefits for Software Developers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Combine modules to build a device with a consistent appearance and shared functionality.</li>
<li>The platform independent architecture ensures a fast and painless porting experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Benefits for Product Managers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrate ENTWRX Applications with custom features as part of a rich overall experience.</li>
<li>Picsel's state of the art features and customer ease-of-use will attract attention to your product.</li>
<li>Picsel's quality and schedule will keep your time-to-market predictable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Benefits for Consumers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intuitive and innovative user interfaces.</li>
<li>Experience content on a mobile device without conversion or loss of detail.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="FVDK_Formats"></a>
File Formats</h1>
<p>TGV products (for example, see <a class="el" href="group__TgvFileViewer.html">File Viewer Development Kit</a>) can be configured to load documents in the industry standard formats shown below, direct from the original files without conversion. These are backed up by Picsel's world famous, high quality font engine with realistic page layout, interactive control and anti-aliased reSecureWrxution enhancement. Other TGV products can benefit from the same format capabilities, according to their purpose; for example the PDF document viewer can only read PDF files.</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Word .doc</li>
<li>Microsoft Excel .xls</li>
<li>Microsoft PowerPoint .ppt</li>
<li>Microsoft Word 2007 .docx</li>
<li>Microsoft Excel 2007 .xlsx</li>
<li>Microsoft PowerPoint 2007 .pptx</li>
<li>Adobe PDF .pdf</li>
<li>Hypertext Markup .html</li>
<li>Single file HTML .mht</li>
<li>Cascading Style Sheets .css</li>
<li>Plain Text .txt</li>
<li>JPEG images .jpg</li>
<li>PNG images .png</li>
<li>GIF images .gif</li>
<li>BMP images .bmp</li>
<li>Windows Metafiles .wmf</li>
<li>Enhanced Metafiles .emf</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="FVDK_Applications"></a>
TGV Applications</h1>
<p>TGV products can be used in a number of ways, according to customer needs. For example, with FVDK (<a class="el" href="group__TgvFileViewer.html">File Viewer Development Kit</a>) you might:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use FVDK in customised file viewers</li>
<li>Read email attachments within client applications</li>
<li>View detailed documentation within vertical-market environments such as medical records.</li>
<li>Load images or files from memory cards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other TGV Products (TgvProducts) allow a range of further actions, from web browsing to menu selections.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="FVDK_Platforms"></a>
Platform compatibility</h1>
<p>Picsel's well established TGV platform independent porting layer to make it easy to integrate. System calls are made through a Picsel-defined API that allows the device manufacturer to intercept or execute each appropriately. This might be used to restrict filing system access to selected folders; memory allocation can be balanced with other applications; and keystrokes can be assigned to suitable functions for action.</p>
<p>Integration on proprietary and RTOS environments has proved as easy as on industry standard systems. ENTWRX provides sample applications in source code demonstrating how it can be used on Symbian, Linux, desktop Windows, Windows Mobile, and other platforms. Code from these may be re-used in the final application, and studied to clarify design.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="FVDK_API_Services"></a>
API services</h1>
<p>Amongst the features offered and requested by the application programmers' interface (API) provided by the SDK are the following. Those required from the application can often be implemented in one line of source code.</p>
<p>Offered by the SecureWrx library to the application:</p>
<ul>
<li>Load Document</li>
<li>Zoom and scroll incrementally</li>
<li>Rotate view, switch to full screen, etc</li>
<li>Hide, redraw, shut down, etc</li>
<li>Change page, go to numbered page</li>
<li>Start search, go to next match, etc</li>
<li>Display small thumbnail of page</li>
</ul>
<p>Required by ENTWRX from application</p>
<ul>
<li>Open file, read data, allocate memory, etc</li>
<li>Copy bitmap showing document to screen</li>
<li>Timer callback</li>
<li>Optionally receive notification, eg loading error</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="FVDK_Performance"></a>
Performance and Requirements</h1>
<p>Picsel's breathtaking display on screen is as powerful as ever in TGV. The time taken to load a document varies, but it will run in small, configurable time slices (defaulting to 200ms) to facilitate shared execution even on non-multi-tasking devices. Most keystroke actions are completed in a moment, giving truly immersive interactivity.</p>
<p>Depending on both release and build-time configuration, the SecureWrx library may require around 1.5Mb of ROM, with approximately 300Kb more for Asian fonts. At run-time, a working heap memory of between 4Mb and 10Mb is recommended. If this memory is exhausted, large documents will be partially loaded. ENTWRX recommends a processor speed of 150MHz or more, and a full colour (16bpp) screen. These figures are for guidance only.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="FVDK_Integration"></a>
Integration Timescale</h1>
<p>FVDK has been delivered on dozens of platforms around the world. While it is OS-independent, ENTWRX recommends a training and support programme to ensure efficient integration and optimal performance. A working prototype is generally demonstrable within two weeks of joint engineering effort, after which a cycle of testing ensures complete satisfaction.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Whats_In_The_Tgv_Box"></a>
What is in the TGV package?</h1>
<p>This TGV software development kit release package will contain the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Link library for the required platform</li>
<li>Link library for Microsoft VC++ built on x86 (when required by the customer)</li>
<li>Header files for the API</li>
<li>Documentation for each of the header files</li>
<li>Release note</li>
<li>Example Alien application source code for a similar device.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each TGV library will have been customised by Picsel:</p>
<ul>
<li>To support the features of the licensed product (TgvProducts) - to include required fonts and character encodings</li>
<li>to run on the required processor architecture</li>
<li>by compiling it with a given compiler, producing the required library format.</li>
</ul>
<p>The TGV library does not contain the following as these are provided by customer in the Alien application:</p>
<ul>
<li>dialogue boxes and user interface, including localisation of strings</li>
<li>key mappings</li>
<li>filing system browsing to choose files to load</li>
<li>device choice</li>
<li>operating system features use such as memory allocation, file access and timers; these must be accessed through the "Alien" interface</li>
</ul>

# 
1. use auto release scripts instead   
2. the scripts will remove:
			1. bootloader
			2  drivers:   /card/nand/hantro/dac/2d/lcm/recover/card upgrade/usb
      3. library:   sdk library(all)
      4. sdk apps:  standby.bin etc 

usage:

#build relative binary than copy to rootfs,remove unrelease code 
step1 :  
		cd sdk/doc
		sh auto_rel.sh AM_XX #e.g. AM_11 AM_13 AM_8251

#build code as normal
step2 :  
		cd ../../scripts
		sh am_sdk_config.sh
		make all
				
when need patch the scripts:
1. release more or less than the above
2. driver makefile/kconfig changed a lot
